I made this project as an assignment for my BootCamp. During the process of coding this game, I fell in love with it, that I tried to one up myself each day. 
Of course every new addition came with some challenges which I googled and tried to figure it out. This being my very first project has helped me learn a lot and get even more hooked in coding.
#This game can be played in a "Single Player" or a "Two Player" mode.
